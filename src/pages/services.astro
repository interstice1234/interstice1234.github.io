      <h2>Grants and Scholarship Application Editing</h2>
      <div class="service-description">
        <p>I've received over 2.1 million USD in personal research grants: Templeton, Marie Curie, Fulbright and others. I've also taught graduate courses on grant writing and broken it down to a science. Let me help you edit your grant proposal and research application! I generally edit proposals within the social sciences and humanities. I give special attention to matching your proposal and application materials to the exact requirements and norms of the grant you are applying for.</p>
        <p>Contact me for my rates (which are flexible based on deadline and background).</p>
        <p>I provide editing at all stages:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
          <li><strong>Developmental editing</strong> (making sure that the structure, argumentation and writing quality matches the purpose and the readership and aims of the grant)</li>
          <li><strong>Line editing</strong> (ensuring clarity, readability and transitional flow within and between paragraphs)</li>
          <li><strong>Copyediting</strong> (correcting mistakes in grammar, formatting, style and punctuation)</li>
          <li><strong>Proofreading</strong> (carefully reading and re-reading the manuscript with an eye to mistakes in typesetting, mechanical errors and any last-second English mistakes or ambiguities)</li>

          <blockquote>"I am among the first people in my family to receive a higher education. After getting my BA from a local university in Canada, Stephen helped me to apply for a DAAD grant in Germany to pursue a MA degree in public health. DAAD is the German Academic Exchange Service and provides free tuition and a living stipend for a MA program. Stephen edited my proposal several times. He refined my research questions and helped me write a compelling narrative. And I got in! Now I've graduated with my MA and live and work in Germany! Thanks to the DAAD scholarship I had no debt coming out of my MA."</blockquote>

I didn't have any experience applying for international grants and Stephen helped edit all my documents. By the end, my research proposal was really tight and my writing sample had correct flow and logic. I highly recommend working with Stephen to get that big grant you've always wanted!"</blockquote>

      <h2>Graduate School Application Editing</h2>
      <div class="service-description">
        <p>I fully understand the complexities of navigating applications for graduate school. Research proposals, CV, personal statements, recommendation letters, timelines, budgets…it can feel overwhelming. How to personalize each proposal to the faculty and resources at that specific university and department? There is a fine line to balance between being academically precise and having a personal touch that can touch the emotions of burned-out committee readers. I've helped many people get into their dream program and I can help you, too!</p>
