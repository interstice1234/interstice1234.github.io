          <h2 class="research-title">New Religiosity and the Digital Study of Eudaimonia</h2>
          <p>Between 2025-27, I am a co-PI (along with Suzanne Newcombe) on a John Templeton Foundation-funded, 1.6-million-euro grant called “New Religiosity and the Digital Study of Eudaimonia” (project # 63357). The project explores a range of key variables relating to religion and wellbeing in a global comparative context. By compiling the world’s largest, most diverse data set on new religiosity, the aim is to make quantitative inferences between ethnographically- and historically-granulated variables and individual eudaimonia, societal flourishing, and new religiosity beyond self-reporting individual affect. We aim to enliven debates about what counts as new religiosity and what underlying structures are correlated with prosocial personal, financial, and societal outcomes. My role is to collect ethnographic data from 200 scholars of East-, Southeast- and South Asian new religions. I also use a citizen science paradigm to collect data via religious group members with ‘insider’ expertise within specific new religions that are not currently represented in scholarship. As part of this project, we will publish an ethnographic film, museum exhibition and research catalog.</p>

          <h2 class="research-title">Dalits within Tribes</h2>
          <p>This doctoral research examines the social life of affirmative action categories in the Western Himalayas. In particular, I examine the grassroots mobilization of five Scheduled Caste groups which self-identify within the Gaddi ‘tribe’ but remain unrecognized by the state and therefore unable to avail themselves of Scheduled Tribe recognition. I explore this double subalternity from the perspective of spirituality, ritual change, pilgrimage, religious conversion and spirit possession. This project was funded by a Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Fellowship.</p>

          <h2 class="research-title">Tibetan Diaspora Politics in India</h2>
          <p>Dharamsala is so strongly associated with the Dalai Lama and Tibetans that its origin as a Gaddi pastoral stopover in the Dhauladhar Mountains is hardly known. This project analyzes the Gaddiness of a ‘tribal’ Dharamsala and explores the fraught relationship between Tibetans and Gaddis over the past several decades. I stress the importance of understanding Dharamsala as ‘Talu’, the original Gaddi name and the most intensely global, capitalistic, politicized area anywhere in the Gaddi world. I also argue that Buddhist cosmopolitanism functions as symbolic capital and structures sociality between Tibetan refugees and Gaddi tribal neighbors in Dharamsala.</p>

          <h2 class="research-title">Cultural Politics of the Tibetan Diaspora in Japan</h2>
          <p>This postdoctoral research explores Japanese engagement with the Tibetan diaspora through art, activism, politics and spirituality. I argue that unique features of Japanese history and culture have led to pragmatic rightward drift among Tibetans and Tibetan-aligned institutions in Japan. This project was funded by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship hosted at Kyoto University.</p>

          <h2 class="research-title">Japanese Alternative Spirituality</h2>
          <p>This project focuses on the Modern Mystery School (MMS), variously described as a spiritual path, a spiritual business, and a spiritual lineage. It was founded in 1997 by an Icelander and is headquartered in Toronto, Tokyo and London. MMS emerged in Japan at the height of the ‘spirituality boom’ and the proliferation of spiritual therapeutic techniques that are often associated with the eclectic categories of Western esotericism or New Age. Of particular interest is the centrality of Tibet and Shambhala in their teachings. This project was funded by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship hosted at Kyoto University.</p>

          <h2 class="research-title">Tibeto-Vietnamese Vajrayana</h2>
          <p>Between 2018-24, as part of a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action Postdoctoral Fellowship (project #101025661) at the University of Copenhagen and while teaching at Vietnam National University, I conducted 15 months of fieldwork on the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in Vietnam—what I call “Tibeto-Vietnamese Vajrayana”. Vietnam is arguably the fastest growing country in the world for Tibetan Buddhism. I analyze transformations in Buddhist patronage (generally away from the West and towards inter-Asian patronage networks), queer sanghas, post-socialist regulative frameworks on ‘foreign’ Buddhism in Vietnam, syncretistic Tibetan Buddhist groups through a lens of lived religious practice, pop culturalization, Buddhist corporate and business ventures, and the rise of Jambhala (the Tibetan wealth deity) among Vietnamese elites.</p>
